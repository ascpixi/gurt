              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-black">Understanding Image Formats</h3>
              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
                Image formats serve different purposes in the digital world. JPG, the most common format, is perfect for photographs and complex images due to its efficient compression. PNG, on the other hand, excels at preserving transparency and maintaining quality for graphics and logos. WebP, the modern format developed by Google, offers superior compression while maintaining quality, making it ideal for web use.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-black">The Conversion Process</h3>
              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
                Converting images between formats involves complex algorithms that analyze and reconstruct image data. Our advanced conversion technology ensures that your images maintain their quality while being optimized for their new format. The process considers factors such as color depth, compression methods, and metadata preservation to deliver the best possible results.

              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
                Modern compression algorithms have revolutionized image optimization. Lossy compression, used in formats like JPG, can reduce file sizes by up to 90% while maintaining acceptable quality. Lossless compression, employed by PNG, preserves every pixel while still achieving significant size reductions. Our converter implements cutting-edge compression techniques to ensure your images are perfectly optimized for web delivery.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-black">Format Selection</h3>
              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
                Choosing the right format is crucial for web optimization. JPG remains the standard for photographs, while PNG is essential for graphics requiring transparency. WebP, the modern format, often provides superior compression compared to both JPG and PNG. Our converter automatically selects the optimal format based on your image content and quality requirements.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-black">Advanced Optimization</h3>
              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
